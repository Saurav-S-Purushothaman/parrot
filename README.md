# Parrot
Parrot is a very simple logging library for Clojure.

## Scope
Parrot is my educational project to learn more about logging and how it
works. Therefore all the features in this projects are going to be very
basic and won't be good enough for a production level logging system. I
hope to make this as polished as other logging library in Clojure like
`timbre` and `pedestal` logging. Even though this is a an eductional
project, I would love to get your feedback on the quality of the code
and library as PR or Issue or by mailing to `saurav.kudajadri@gmail.com`
